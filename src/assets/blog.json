          "content": "Once upon a time (specifically, in the early 1900s), the T-shirt didn’t even *exist* in its current form. Men wore uncomfortable, sweat-inducing wool shirts underneath their military uniforms. Enter the U.S. Navy, who decided that sailors needed a better option. Around 1913, they introduced the **short-sleeved, crew-necked undershirt**—and lo, the T-shirt was born! Though, it wasn’t called that yet. Instead, it was merely an undergarment, hidden from the world like a shy introvert at a party."

In 1920, **F. Scott Fitzgerald** (yes, the guy who wrote *The Great Gatsby*) became one of the first to actually write the word \"T-shirt\" in his novel *This Side of Paradise.* It was officially on the literary map."

We’re talking **Marlon Brando** in *A Streetcar Named Desire* and **James Dean** in *Rebel Without a Cause.* These guys wore their T-shirts like they were armor, signaling rebellion, toughness, and effortless cool. Suddenly, every young man in America needed a white T-shirt, and they weren’t about to hide it under anything."

It’s soft, breathable, and perfect for lounging around or sweating through a summer BBQ. Cotton comes from the fluffy fibers of the cotton plant, and it’s known for being hypoallergenic and eco-friendly—just like that super-nice neighbor who always lets you borrow their lawn mower.\n\nBut while cotton’s got softness in spades, it’s not without flaws. It wrinkles easily, can shrink in the wash, and over time, it might start to pill (those annoying little fuzz balls). Still, when it comes to comfort, cotton is the undefeated champ."

Polyester’s not here to play—it’s durable, holds its shape, and resists wrinkles like it’s allergic to them. This fabric doesn’t soak up moisture like cotton, which makes it perfect for athletic wear (say goodbye to sweat stains).\n\nOn the downside, polyester isn’t the most breathable material in the world. Wear it on a hot day, and you might feel like you’re trapped in a sauna. But in terms of longevity and toughness, polyester packs a punch."

You get the comfort of cotton, but with the durability and wrinkle-resistance of polyester. It’s like marrying a yoga instructor to a structural engineer—you get flexibility *and* strength.\n\nThis blend is super popular for T-shirts because it’s versatile. It holds its shape, doesn’t shrink as much, and is less prone to wrinkles. So, if you want a fabric that can take you from casual Fridays to weekend adventures, this might be your best bet."

          "content": "Screen printing is the **OG** of T-shirt design—it’s been around since the 1900s, and it’s still going strong. This method involves creating a stencil (or screen) for each color in your design. Then, ink is pressed through the screens onto the fabric, one color at a time. The result? Bold, durable designs that can last wash after wash. If you’ve ever had a band tee that survived a mosh pit *and* the laundry machine, it was probably screen printed.\n\nPros: Perfect for simple, bold designs and large orders. The ink becomes part of the fabric, so your design won't peel or fade easily.\n\nCons: Not ideal for intricate, multi-colored designs. Each color requires a separate screen, which can add to the cost."

It’s great for intricate designs and one-off shirts, like that time you needed a custom tee for your dog’s birthday (we’ve all been there).\n\nPros: Super detailed designs with lots of colors. Ideal for small orders or one-off custom tees.\n\nCons: Designs can crack or peel over time, especially after lots of washing. Not as durable as screen printing."

This method allows for super detailed, multi-colored designs without the hassle of screens or transfers. Plus, the ink soaks into the fabric, so the design feels soft to the touch.\n\nPros: Great for detailed, full-color designs. No need to create multiple screens—just hit \"print\" and go.\n\nCons: Not the best for large orders, as it can be time-consuming. Also, the fabric needs to be pre-treated, which adds an extra step to the process."
